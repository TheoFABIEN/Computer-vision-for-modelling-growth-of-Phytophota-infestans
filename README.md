# Computer-vision-for-modelling-growth-of-Phytophota-infestans

This repository contains the code I used to segment lesions and model the growth of Phytophtora infestans on leaves of Solanum tuberosum (potatoe). This was done during my internship at INRAE (Rennes, France), during my second year of Master's degree.
