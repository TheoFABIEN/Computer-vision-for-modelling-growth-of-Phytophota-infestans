# Computer-vision-for-modelling-growth-of-Phytophota-infestans

This work is still in progress.

This repository contains the code I used to segment lesions and model the growth of Phytophtora infestans on leaves of Solanum tuberosum (potatoe). This was done during my internship at INRAE (Rennes, France), during my second year of Master's degree.

Segmentation : the goal was to compare the performances of different segmentation approaches. Other methods are yet to be tried.

Image registration: soon.

Growth model: soon.
